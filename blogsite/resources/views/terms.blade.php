        <h3>Why Have a Terms and Conditions on Blogger</h3>

        <ul>
            <li>   You might think that a Terms and Conditions agreement (T&C) sounds too formal for your style of blogging. But anyone on Blogger can benefit from it.</li>
            <li>Think back to your school years. During the first day of school, you'd meet your teachers and each would go through a list of rules and expectations. The day was an easy one because they didn't assign homework, but you still learned something.</li>
            <li>Understanding what your teacher expected of your and what you could reasonably expect from your teacher made your classroom run smoothly. Everyone knew their role, and those rules were a point of reference in case you turned your homework in late.</li>
            <li>The same principle applies to Terms and Conditions for Bloggers.</li>
        </ul>
