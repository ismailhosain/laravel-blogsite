               <p>Blogger/BlogSpot doesn't require you to have a Privacy Policy in all circumstances, but there's a good chance you might need one anyway thanks to regulations from the state of California (CalOPPA) and the European Union (the GDPR).

Both of these laws demand that all websites that collect personal data must have a Privacy Policy. That could even include your Blogger/BlogSpot site.

If you use Google Analytics, add third-party links, or collect any data, then a Privacy Policy is a legal requirement, part of your vendor's Terms of Service, and a smart business decision - even if you're just getting started in the blogosphere.</p>
